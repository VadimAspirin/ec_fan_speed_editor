# EC Fan Speed Editor

First of all, the project was created to **adjust the fan speed** of the `MSI GF66 Katana` (Embedded Controller `ems1583`) laptop without having to install and run `MSI Center`.  

In fact, this project provides all the functionality that was available in `MSI Center` (and even more), so it can be considered its **third-party counterpart**.  

To support any other laptop model where the fans are controlled by an Embedded Controller, you can add your own configuration file similar to the [`data/ems1583.json`](data/ems1583.json) file that matches your version of the Embedded Controller.
